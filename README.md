# Podium Pro

This is a proof-of-concept webiste for a Startup Weekend competition. The idea was to create a website that would allow people to practice speech giving and get feedback from other users, sort of like an online Toastmasters. 

It's pretty rushed prototype code, but it was good enough to win 2nd place that weekend!
